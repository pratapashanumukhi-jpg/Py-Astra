# 🐍 Py Astra – Interactive Python Voice Assistant

Py Astra is an interactive **voice-based Python tutoring assistant** built using Python and Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro).  
It listens to user queries through speech, understands them using AI, and responds with clear Python explanations using text-to-speech.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Py Astra acts like a personal Python tutor.  
Users can ask Python-related questions using their voice, and Py Astra responds intelligently with spoken answers.  
It supports both **short answers** and **detailed explanations** based on user commands.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### ✅ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

### 🌇Clone the Repository

```bash

cd Py-Astra
 ```
### ✅ Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
  ```

### ✅ Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using the command below.
Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate

 ```
If requirements.txt is not available:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai speechrecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
 ```
* with your Google Generative AI API Key.

### ▶️ How to Run the Project
```bash
python main.py
 ```

### 4️⃣ API Configuration
* For API Key: Visit Google AI Studio to get your API key.
Open main.py and replace:
```bash
API_KEY = 'Your_api_key'
 ```
* For Model: If you want to use a different model than the default (gemini-pro), you can:
* Visit the Google AI Studio to browse and select the model that best suits your needs.

### ⚠️ Note:

* Google provides a free tier for Generative AI with limited monthly usage.
  
* If you exceed the free quota or use premium models, charges may apply.
  
* Use Responsibly, stay within free limits and avoid unexpected charges.

### 🧑‍💻 How Py Astra Works

* Listens to the user’s voice input

* Converts speech to text

* Sends query to Gemini AI

* Receives Python-based response

* Converts text to speech and speaks back

---

### 🚀 Usage
* Run the script:
 ```bash
   python Py Astra.py
 ```

* Speak your Python-related question when prompted.

* Py Astra will respond with a spoken answer.

* Say "explain in detail" or "give me more details" if you want a longer explanation.

* Say "exit" anytime to stop the program.
